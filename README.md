# Kick View Bot

Hello, my name is AnonX. I created a simple view bot for the new streaming site called kick.com, I have been working on this for quite some time now to ensure that it had little to no issues upon it's public release.

This tool is to only be used for preventing view botting on your own website, via testing using this tool. I do not condone using this on kick.com or any other streaming platform.

## Installation

1: Download Python 3.10 from the Microsoft store

2: Open a command prompt in the folder with the Python files

3: Install using these commands

```bash
  pip install tk
  pip install selenium
  pip install undetected_chromedriver
  python KickViewBot.py

```

## Credit
I do ask that anyone that uses this tool please leave the credits in the script, yes the script is open source but getting credit for something I made is just as cool as it being free to use. Thank You!
